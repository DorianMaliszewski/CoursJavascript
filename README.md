## How quiz works

- There are a google drive folder where we put all tests
- You need to create one from the `template.json`, change `template` by the name of the quiz that will be used in the url.
- If you named it `example.json` you can access it through `/fr/quiz/example/`
- Questions are choosen randomly by selecting one not answered by the student
- **TO PROVENT CHEATING**: When the land on a new question it cant change the question number in the url, it will count as  false answer
